## 📄 License

Everything in this repository is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE), with one exception: [`cloudpdf/server`](cloudpdf/server) — the self-hostable CloudPDF server — is **Fair Source**, under the [Fair Core License, FCL-1.0-ALv2](cloudpdf/server/LICENSE). Its source may be inspected, copied, and modified for purposes permitted by the FCL. **That does not make the server free to run:** while a release remains under the FCL, running or self-hosting it requires a valid CloudPDF license (a license key for a connected deployment or a signed certificate for an air-gapped deployment). You may not move, change, disable, or circumvent the license-key functionality; enable protected functionality without a valid license; or remove protected functionality. Competing Uses, as defined in the FCL, are also prohibited. Each release automatically becomes Apache-2.0 two years after publication. See [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md) for the full licensing map, including website content.
