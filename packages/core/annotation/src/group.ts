/**
 * Group membership — the pure, model-level view of an annotation group.
 *
 * A group is a primary annotation plus its subordinate members. Persistence is
 * the engine's `/IRT` + `/RT /Group` relationship; in the model a subordinate
 * carries `group = <primary's id>` (its `refKey`). The primary is NOT stamped —
 * it is simply the annotation whose `id` equals the group key, so membership is
 * the set of annotations pointing at it plus the primary itself.
 *
 * ATTACHED LINK CHILDREN are the exception: they ride the same `/RT /Group`
 * wire mechanism but are NOT part of the composite visual — they're substrate
 * plumbing (the parent's link property). They never count as members here, so
 * a linked square still selects as a SINGLE annotation with handles, never
 * shows Ungroup, and the ungroup verb can never strip an attached link's
 * `/IRT` (which would orphan it into an unmanaged standalone document link).
