/**
 * The kernel host — one service owns the kernel; ONE tick signal bridges the
 * kernel's single change stream into Angular's signal graph. Everything else in
 * this adapter is `computed()` over it (`value()` is Angular's `useKernelValue`).
 *
 * Two hosting modes share this class:
 *   component-hosted  `<epdf-viewer [engine] [plugins]>`  (framework parity)
 *   provider-hosted   `provideEmbedPdf({...})` at route/app level
 *
 * CONSTRUCTION RULE (library law): nothing may read `host.kernel` while a
 * component is being CONSTRUCTED. Component-hosted configs resolve their inputs
 * lazily, so the kernel materializes on first real read (a template binding, an
 * effect) — after inputs are set. Every inject* primitive returns signals or
 * lazy methods and therefore respects this for free; only the raw
 * `injectKernel()` escape hatch can violate it (its doc says so).
 *
 * SSR CONTRACT: the EmbedPDF subtree is browser-only. On the server the host
 * never boots and any `kernel` read throws — wrap the viewer region in `@defer`
 * (which renders its placeholder on the server) or a platform-guarded `@if`.
