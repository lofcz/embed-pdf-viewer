/**
 * The worker-thread bootstrap, shared by the two worker deliveries:
 *
 *   - `./worker-entry.ts` — shipped as raw TS source (`@embedpdf/engine/worker-entry`),
 *     compiled by the consumer's bundler (Vite `?worker`, manual `new Worker`).
 *   - `workers/embedpdf-worker.js` — a self-contained BUILT artifact (Emscripten
 *     glue statically bundled), used two ways: stringified into
 *     `workers/embedpdf-worker.source.js` for the default inline-blob spawn, and
 *     copied verbatim by strict-CSP users as a same-origin static worker.
 *
 * Boot is INIT-DRIVEN: the worker does nothing until the main thread posts
 * `{ kind: 'init', wasmUrl?, wasmBinary? }` (see resolveWasmSource — the main
 * thread decides where the wasm comes from; the worker never guesses). Then it
 * creates the WASM runtime in this thread, wires a {@link WorkerHost} to
 * `postMessage`, and answers with the `ready` / `init-error` handshake that
 * `BrowserWorkerTransport.spawn` waits on.
 *
 * Messages posted before the worker script finishes evaluating are buffered by
 * the platform (a dedicated worker's port is enabled after the initial run),
 * so the main thread may post `init` immediately after `new Worker(...)`.
