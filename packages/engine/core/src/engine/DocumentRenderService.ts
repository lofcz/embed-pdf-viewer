/**
 * The engine's render-parameter policy.
 *
 * - `continuous` — any viewport renders exactly as requested. The LOCAL
 *   engine always answers this: rendering is in-process, there is no
 *   shared cache to protect, and exactness is the local product promise.
 * - `lattice` — the deployment treats a finite set of render points as
 *   durable, CDN-shared artifacts. The bounded quantity
 *   is OUTPUT PIXELS, never zoom:
 *
 *   - `fullPage.widths` — full-page renders quantize on `viewport.width`
 *     (a scale lattice bounds artifact COUNT but not SIZE: PDF page space
 *     is effectively unbounded, so scale 1 of a poster page is a memory
 *     bomb while width caps the dominant dimension by construction).
 *   - `tiles` — RESERVED for the deep-zoom vertical: a scale-based
 *     pyramid × fixed tile size, where per-job cost is constant. Absent
 *     until the tiling plugin ships; reserving the shape keeps the SDK
 *     contract from churning twice.
 *   - `maxRenderPixels` — the worker-side output budget for degenerate
 *     geometry (width bounds width, not height).
 *
 * The SDK never conforms a request implicitly — the same `render.image`
 * call must not return different pixels on local vs cloud. Conformance is
 * the caller's visible choice via {@link snapFullPageViewport}.
