/**
 * Digital signatures on the document: the read side (what is signed, what
 * it seals, what it forbids) and the two-phase signing protocol. The
 * engine does the PDF job — candidate file, digest, sealing — and never
 * holds a key; the CMS comes from the caller (`@embedpdf/core-signature`
 * builds one from a raw signer, or a signing service returns it).
 *
 * Every read here describes the bytes the document was loaded from
 * (for a layer document: base + the delta it was opened with). Unsaved
 * edits are not part of any revision until `prepare` snapshots them.
 *
 * Reads ride `doc.forms.read`; `revisionBytes` rides `doc.download`;
 * `prepare`/`complete`/`abort` ride `doc.sign`, a certification
 * additionally `doc.sign.certify`.
