/**
 * Where a link annotation points, NORMALIZED. A link may carry either a
 * direct `/Dest` or an `/A` action (ISO 32000-1 §12.5.6.5); to a viewer a
 * `/Dest` and a `/A GoTo` are the same intent, so the engine collapses both
 * onto the `goto` arm — clients never see the raw two-shape split (the v2
 * `target.action.destination` double-wrap). Named destinations are resolved
 * to explicit ones engine-side, the same rule {@link PdfDestination}
 * documents.
 *
 * Arm names follow the `PdfActionType` vocabulary (`goto`, `uri`,
 * `goto-remote`, `launch`, `javascript`) so the two action-shaped surfaces
 * never drift.
 *
 * `goto-remote`, `launch`, and `javascript` are READ-ONLY in v1: the
 * engine reports them so a client can display/inspect (or, for
 * `javascript`, hand the link to the scripting orchestrator), but never
 * follows or executes them here, and refuses to write them (see
 * {@link PdfLinkTargetWritable}). `javascript` deliberately carries NO
 * script payload — the text already rides the base
 * `actions.activate` model, which is the scripting plane's single home
 * for action scripts. `unsupported` preserves round-trip for action
 * types the reader doesn't model.
