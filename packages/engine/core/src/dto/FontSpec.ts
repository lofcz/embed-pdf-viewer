 * is shared by every page render and annotation-authoring call on its thread.
 * The engine surfaces them through {@link FontService} (`engine.fonts`), not on
 * a `DocumentHandle`.
 *
 * The numeric `CFX_FontRegistry::FontId` returned by the native registry is
 * thread-local and volatile (a per-thread `next_font_id++`). It is deliberately
 * NOT exposed here. Callers key fonts by the stable {@link FontKey} they choose
 * at registration, so a worker respawn (or a future worker pool) can replay the
 * same registration order and rebind keys to whatever ids come back.
