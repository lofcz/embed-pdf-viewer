## 3.0.0-next.7

## 3.0.0-next.6

### Patch Changes

- [#768](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/768) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Bound individual annotation-appearance raster allocations at deep zoom by reducing the effective appearance scale while preserving the original placement rectangle. Oversized page-spanning appearances now degrade softly instead of exhausting the wasm heap with multi-gigabyte bitmap requests.

## 3.0.0-next.5

### Minor Changes

- [#759](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/759) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Build validated full-fidelity page text snapshots from the runtime's text and character-map calls. Search now converts matched string offsets back into character-space ranges before producing hit geometry, so search, selection, and copied text remain aligned when extracted text diverges from PDF character slots.

## 3.0.0-next.4

### Minor Changes

- [#755](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/755) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Replace the parallel `rects[]` and `quads[]` geometry on `SearchMatch` with canonical `segments: PdfTextSegment[]`, validated by `PdfTextSegmentSchema`.

  Search tokens now always encode `format=segments1`, preventing newer clients from consuming stale CDN-cached responses with the old geometry shape; old tokens fail decoding instead.

- [#755](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/755) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Persist and render caret rotation through the engine annotation services.
  - Read and write the caret `rotation` and `unrotatedRect` metadata pair during create, patch, and list operations.
  - Treat caret subtype 14 as box-family when rendering annotation appearances, returning a rotation-stripped raster placed by the logical box so consumers do not double-rotate it after reload.

- [#755](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/755) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Reads boxes, oriented cells, flags, and text orientation through the new runtime geometry call, preserving the compact upright wire shape while emitting rotated runs for non-upright glyphs. Native page-redaction failures are now reported instead of being mistaken for pages without redaction annotations.

## 3.0.0-next.3

## 3.0.0-next.2

## 3.0.0-next.1

## 3.0.0-next.0

### Major Changes

- [#711](https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer/pull/711) by [@bobsingor](https://github.com/bobsingor) – Introduces the runtime-independent Engine v3 service implementations. The same document, page, annotation, form, search, and mutation logic runs over both the local WASM runtime and CloudPDF's native worker runtime.
