/**
 * The ONE place React becomes Preact. Everything above this build — the
 * chrome, the React adapter — is written against react/react-dom; this
 * config aliases the whole family to preact/compat, so the shipped artifact
 * carries no React and peers with nothing. Consumers (CDN scripts, framework
 * wrappers) load dist — they never compile the chrome themselves.
 *
 * TWO BUILD PASSES (see package.json's build script):
 *
 *   1. `vite build` — the npm entry (`dist/index.js`). The engine is
 *      EXTERNALIZED: it is pure TS (no react aliasing needed), and consumers'
 *      bundlers must process it themselves so the engine's bundler-resolved
 *      wasm default (`new URL('./lib/embedpdf.wasm', import.meta.url)` inside
 *      @embedpdf/engine-runtime-wasm32/wasm-url) lands in THEIR asset
 *      pipeline — that is what makes <PDFViewer> zero-config in Next/Vite.
 *      Prebundling the engine would freeze that URL against this package
 *      instead, and Vite lib mode would inline the 6 MB binary as base64.
 *
 *   2. `vite build --mode snippet` — the CDN artifact (`dist/embedpdf.js`),
 *      fully self-contained: engine bundled, `embedpdf.wasm` copied to dist as
 *      the snippet's self-located sibling (src/snippet.ts), and the engine's
 *      wasm-url module stubbed out (the snippet never consults the default,
 *      and the stub keeps the binary out of the JS).
