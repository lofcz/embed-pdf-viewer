# @embedpdf/viewer-chrome

The full viewer, as one React component. This package is the **single
implementation** of the snippet UI — the measured toolbar, mode bands, panels,
tab bar, theme — consumed by `@embedpdf/viewer` (the Preact-compiled
`<embedpdf-viewer>` custom element) and every framework wrapper. It is private:
apps install a delivery package, not the chrome.

The customization surface below is **the** contract: the same object shape
later powers `EmbedPDF.init({ ... })` and every wrapper's props, because all of
it is plain data — nothing here is React-specific except the component itself.

## Quickstart

```tsx
import { FullViewer } from '@embedpdf/viewer-chrome';
import '@embedpdf/viewer-chrome/styles.css';
import { localEngine } from '@embedpdf/engine';

<FullViewer
  engine={() => localEngine()}
  initialDocuments={[{ name: 'Report', source: reportBytes }]}
/>;
```

Everything renders at t≈0; only the pages wait on the wasm engine.

## Customizing

Two kinds of surface, two deliberate semantics:

- **Registries** (`commands`, `icons`, `strings`) are **additive**: your
  entries merge over the defaults by id; a colliding id overrides. Safe,
  order-independent, upgrade-friendly.
- **Structure** (`chrome`) is a **value you own**: take the default, transform
  it, or write your own. It is never merged — there is no patch grammar to
  learn, because the schema is small enough to read.

### Remove features

```tsx
<FullViewer engine={engine} disabledCategories={['form', 'redaction']} />
```

A disabled category vanishes everywhere at once — toolbar, menus, overflow,
shortcuts — because every surface is a projection of the same command registry.

### Add a button

The 90% case, end to end — one command, one icon, one string, one placement:

```tsx
<FullViewer
  engine={engine}
  icons={{
    // 24×24 stroke path data — Tabler/Lucide icons paste in verbatim.
    send: [
      'M10 14L21 3',
      'M21 3l-6.5 18a.5.5 0 0 1-1 0L10 14l-7-3.5a.5.5 0 0 1 0-1L21 3z',
    ],
  }}
  strings={{
    en: { 'acme.send': 'Send for signature' },
    nl: { 'acme.send': 'Verstuur ter ondertekening' },
  }}
  commands={[
    {
      id: 'acme:send',
      labelKey: 'acme.send',
      icon: 'send',
      shortcut: 'Mod+Shift+S',
      enabled: (ctx) => ctx.documentId !== null,
      run: (ctx) => {
        void fetch(`/api/sign/${ctx.documentId}`, { method: 'POST' });
      },
    },
  ]}
  chrome={(base, h) =>
    h.addItem(base, {
      bar: 'main',
      section: 'end',
      group: 'panels',
      item: 'acme:send',
    })
  }
/>
```

That one registration is a button that degrades responsively (`importance` is
the only responsive knob — there are no breakpoints to edit), drops into the
derived overflow menu on narrow screens, has a working keyboard shortcut, and
is localized. Referencing an unknown command or icon logs a dev-mode warning
naming the exact id.

`chrome` accepts the schema **value** or a **transform** of the default. The
helpers come in as the second argument so simple edits need no imports:

```tsx
chrome={(base, h) =>
  h.removeItems(
    h.replaceItem(base, 'panel:comment', { command: 'acme:chat', importance: 5 }),
    ['annotation:add-squiggly'],
  )
}
```

- `h.addItem(schema, { bar, section, group, item, at? })` — `bar` is a bar id
  (`'main'`, a mode bar like `'annotate'`, or a strip); a new `group` id
  creates that group at the end of the section.
- `h.removeItems(schema, ids)` — purges the commands from every bar, mode bar,
  strip, and menu; emptied groups disappear.
- `h.replaceItem(schema, id, item)` — swaps a command in place, everywhere.
- Plus the authoring sugar (`h.item`, `h.group`, `h.custom`, `h.defineChrome`)
  for building bigger pieces inline.

### Own the structure

For real restructuring, don't patch — write the value. It is the complete
structural definition of the viewer, and it is small:

```tsx
import {
  FullViewer,
  defineChrome,
  group,
  custom,
  defaultChrome,
} from '@embedpdf/viewer-chrome';

// A minimal "reading room": zoom, search, download. Nothing else.
const chrome = defineChrome({
  bars: {
    main: {
      id: 'main',
      sections: {
        start: [
          group('zoom', [
            custom('zoom-controls', {
              variants: ['inline', 'button'],
              terminal: 'zoom:menu',
            }),
          ]),
        ],
        end: [group('actions', ['panel:search', 'document:download'])],
      },
    },
  },
  menus: { zoom: defaultChrome.menus.zoom },
});

<FullViewer engine={engine} chrome={chrome} />;
```

Adding an entry under `chrome.modeBars` adds a whole mode: the mode tab strip
is derived from `modeBars` keys, so a custom review workflow is one command
(the mode surface) plus one bar schema — not a special case.

Your stability, your choice: pass no `chrome` and you track our default (new
features appear on upgrade); own the value and your toolbar never moves — new
EmbedPDF features arrive as new command ids you opt into by adding a line.

### Locale

```tsx
<FullViewer engine={engine} locale="es" />        // fixed
<FullViewer engine={engine} locale="auto" />      // negotiate from the browser (default)
```

`strings` may target any locale code, with dotted keys (`'acme.send'`)
expanding into the pack. A code with no built-in pack becomes a new locale that
falls back to English for everything you didn't provide.

### Slots — your component inside the measured toolbar

Reserve a socket in the chrome (`custom()` with a `terminal` command), then —
through `<embedpdf-viewer>` or any wrapper — supply a child with the matching
`slot` attribute:

```tsx
// @embedpdf/viewer-react
<PDFViewer
  src="/report.pdf"
  commands={[{ id: 'acme:status', labelKey: 'acme.status', run: () => {} }]}
  chrome={(base, h) =>
    h.addItem(base, {
      bar: 'main',
      section: 'start',
      group: 'workspace',
      item: h.custom('doc-status', { terminal: 'acme:status' }),
    })
  }
>
  <DocStatus slot="doc-status" />
</PDFViewer>
```

The child stays in YOUR world — light DOM, your framework's tree, your page
CSS — while the browser projects it into the toolbar. The socket is measured
live, so the solver budgets its true width; when it no longer fits, the
`terminal` command represents it in the derived overflow menu. An unfilled
socket displays its terminal command as native slot fallback, so the same
chrome works with and without the child (and outside shadow DOM entirely —
this package's own React consumers see the fallback).

Slot names must be unique across the chrome (one `<slot name>` per shadow
tree wins projection).

### The frame — regions: arrangement, visibility, replacement

Regions are a FIXED vocabulary (`header`, `tabs`, the toolbar band — each
carries semantics the shell owns: measurement physics, the document gate,
aria). Three independent knobs on each:

```tsx
// 1. ARRANGE + HIDE — part of the chrome value, because it is structure:
chrome={(base) => ({
  ...base,
  frame: { toolbar: 'bottom', tabs: 'multiple', header: false },
})}

// 2. REPLACE — regions are sockets; the built-in is the slot fallback:
<PDFViewer documents={docs} onReady={setViewer}>
  <AcmeTabBar slot="tabs" viewer={viewer} />
</PDFViewer>
```

`header` is the one region with **no** built-in: the viewer ships no brand
row, locale picker or theme switch, because that chrome belongs to your app,
not to the PDF. The socket is there so yours can sit inside the frame:

```tsx
<PDFViewer documents={docs}>
  <AcmeHeader slot="header" />
</PDFViewer>
```

Left unfilled it renders nothing, and `frame: { header: false }` drops the
socket entirely. Theme and locale stay under your control as props —
`theme={{ preference, tokens }}` and `locale` (`'auto'` negotiates from the
browser) — so a switch in your own header is a state change on your side.

A replacement region is fully functional through the handle — the kernel's
document registry IS the tab model (`viewer.documents.list()/activeId()/
setActive()/close()` + `viewer.watch`). A region hidden by the frame hides
its socket too: visibility outranks slotted content. The mode band rides the
main toolbar's content side (below a top bar, above a bottom bar).

### Drive — control the viewer from code

The handle (`el.viewer` on the custom element, `onReady` on the wrappers) is a
thin skin over the kernel: `get(Token)` returns each plugin's **public
capability lens** verbatim — the same documented API the chrome's own buttons
use — plus ONE reactivity primitive and the command trio:

```ts
el.addEventListener('epdf:ready', () => {
  const viewer = el.viewer;

  viewer.execute('zoom:in'); // commands: UI verbs
  const annotation = viewer.get(AnnotationToken); // capabilities: the API
  await annotation.create(pon, draft);

  viewer.watch(
    // the one primitive
    () => annotation.getSelectionProps(),
    (props) => myPanel.render(props),
  );
  viewer.documents.list(); // the tab model
});
```

Rule of thumb: **buttons speak commands; code speaks capabilities.** The
token re-export list in `index.ts` is the public-API act — internal lenses
(`/internal` entries) are structurally absent from delivery bundles. Coarse
DOM events (`epdf:ready`, `epdf:documentchange`) are sugar over `watch`.

### Theme — match your brand

```tsx
theme={{
  preference: 'system',
  tokens: { accent: '#7c3aed', 'accent-hover': '#6d28d9' },  // both modes
  dark: { accent: '#a78bfa' },                               // dark overrides
}}
```

Token names are the `--ep-*` variables in `styles.css` without the prefix —
the prefix exists because custom properties inherit through shadow boundaries,
so unprefixed names could collide with the host page. The custom element
adopts the overrides into its shadow root; direct consumers of this package
just set the `--ep-*` variables in their own CSS.

### Restyle — reshape built-ins with page CSS

Key elements carry shadow `part` attributes, so plain page CSS reaches them:

```css
embedpdf-viewer::part(toolbar-button) {
  border-radius: 2px;
}
embedpdf-viewer::part(tab-active) {
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

The v1 part vocabulary — public API, grown by demand, never speculatively:
`toolbar`, `toolbar-button(-active)`, `mode-tab(-active)`, `tab(-active)`,
`menu`, `menu-item(-active)`.

## What's deliberately NOT here (yet)

- **The element registry** (`elements: { button: 'tag' }` + exported base
  classes) — the last move of the six-move model.
- **More regions & parts** — `header`/`tabs` sockets and the part list above
  are the v1 vocabulary; grow by demand (names are public API).
- **Radius/density/font tokens** — the token set is the color vocabulary
  today; spacing/shape tokens need a component sweep and land separately.
