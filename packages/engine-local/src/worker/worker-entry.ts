/**
 * Web Worker bootstrap for engine-local.
 *
 * This file is not part of the package's main bundle. Consumers wire it
 * up via Vite's `?worker` import (or a similar bundler primitive). At
 * runtime it:
 *   1. Creates the WASM runtime in this worker thread.
 *   2. Builds a WorkerHost wired to postMessage.
 *   3. Forwards every incoming postMessage to the host.
 *
 * Lives in src/ so consumers can import it as a worker source. It is NOT
 * exported by index.ts.
