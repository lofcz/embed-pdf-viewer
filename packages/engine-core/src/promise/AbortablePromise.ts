 * Awaitable Promise subclass with abort and progress.

 * Symbol.species returns plain Promise so chained .then/.catch/.finally
 * return regular promises and never try to synthesize a new
 * AbortablePromise (which would have no executor).
 *
 * Settlement contract:
 *   - The first settlement wins. resolve/reject handed to the executor
 *     are wrapped so that any subsequent call (whether by the executor,
 *     by abort(), or by both racing) becomes a silent no-op.
 *   - abort() rejects the public promise with AbortError immediately,
 *     even if the executor never observes the AbortSignal. The executor
 *     still receives the AbortSignal so it can stop real work
 *     cooperatively (release a queue slot, abort fetch, post a worker
 *     abort, etc.). Anything the executor does after that — including
 *     a late resolve(value), a late reject(error), or a rejected inner
 *     Promise inside AbortablePromise.run — is dropped silently.
 *   - abort() after settlement is a no-op.
