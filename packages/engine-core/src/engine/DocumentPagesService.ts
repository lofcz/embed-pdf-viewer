/**
 * Document-scoped page service exposed via `DocumentHandle.pages`.

 * touching "many things at the document level" lives in one place. The
 * structure verbs are `move`, `rotate`, and `delete`; the surface is
 * designed for `insert` to slot in without API churn.
 *
 * Identity rule: pages are addressed by indirect `pageObjectNumber`
 * everywhere except `list()`, which exposes display order through
 * `PageState.pageIndex`. There is no "weak page ref" model — structure
 * verbs therefore do not bump per-page revisions and do not invalidate
 * any in-flight annotation refs on surviving pages.
