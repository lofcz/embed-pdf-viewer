   * no indirect object number), the engine stamps a fresh
   * engine-generated UUID v4 as /NM during the update. The returned ref

   * update cache keys.
   *
   * /NM is monotonic per annotation:
   *   - if the annotation is already durable (has /NM or has objectNumber),
   *     the engine NEVER touches /NM during update;
   *   - if the annotation is weak, the engine always stamps a UUID v4.
   *
   * The /NM value is opaque to the engine. Callers that need a specific
   * id for tenant-side bookkeeping should set `draft.nm` at creation
   * time (the only place caller-supplied identity is accepted), or
   * maintain a Map<engine-id, tenant-id> on their side. There is
   * intentionally no `patch.nm` — a stable id that callers can rename
   * mid-session is not stable.
