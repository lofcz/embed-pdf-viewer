   * snapping and settle-gated rendering wait for the END of the gesture, not

   * gesture cancels any running tween or fling — that is how a finger
   * "catches" a moving page.

   * `elastic` opts the gesture into RUBBER-BAND overscroll: pans past the
   * clamp stretch on the iOS resistance curve instead of stopping dead, and
   * ending the gesture (or a fling reaching an edge) springs the camera home
   * on a critically-damped curve. The clamp itself stays the untouched law of
   * REST — elasticity is a transient the gesture is allowed to hold, never a
   * state the camera can settle in. Touch contacts pass it; mouse drags and
   * wheel pans stay rigid (the desktop convention). Default false.
