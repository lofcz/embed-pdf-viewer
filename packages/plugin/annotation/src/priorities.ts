/**
 * The interaction-hub priorities of the annotation plugin's handlers — the
 * public contract a sibling plugin builds on when it needs to sit ABOVE or
 * BELOW one of them for the same gesture. Priority only breaks ties between
 * simultaneously-ELIGIBLE handlers (the tool's tags decide eligibility).
 *
 *   1000 annotation-ghost   never captures; hides the footprint ghost on every down
 *    100 annotation-edit    select/move/resize over an existing annotation
 *     95 annotation-place   click-to-place an armed payload on empty page space
 *     55 annotation-draw    drag-create under a draw tool (below text-select)
 *     50 annotation-marquee empty-space selection, the final fallback
 *
 * A handler that must win a click over an existing annotation while a
 * placing tool is active (a signature mark dropped onto a signature field)
 * registers above {@link ANNOTATION_EDIT_PRIORITY}, not merely above place:
 * the edit handler captures first over any annotation, a widget included.
