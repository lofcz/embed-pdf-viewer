 * The annotation plane's E/X trigger feed — a thin adapter from the ONE
 * pointer-driven hover seam (the `hoverAt` diff) onto the shared hover pump.
 *
 * Anti-cascade is structural and lives in the CALLER's seam placement:
 * reducer-side hover clears (session-hide, remove, reload) never pass
 * through `hoverAt`, so an effect-induced hover loss can never masquerade as
 * a cursor exit. This module only decides WHO is hoverable here:
 *
 * - Drafts (no engine ref) can't carry /AA — skipped.
 * - Widgets and links belong to their own event planes (fill controls /
 *   LinkLayer anchors own their pixels). When they ARE hit-testable on this
 *   plane, an authoring tool owns them — firing hover actions while editing
 *   would be wrong — so they are skipped unconditionally.
 * - Tree-less annotations are FREE: no target, no dispatch, and per-event
 *   flags keep a lone /E or /X from dispatching its inert twin.
