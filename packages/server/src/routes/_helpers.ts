 *
 * History note: these helpers used to be copy-pasted across
 * `annotations.ts`, `pages.ts`, and `metadata.ts`. The
 * `abortSignalFromRequest` variant in `metadata.ts` was the original,
 * naive version that aborts on every `close` event — which silently
 * fires for body-bearing requests (POST/PATCH) the moment Fastify
 * finishes consuming the JSON body. Consolidating to one
 * implementation here ensures every route file gets the fixed
 * "abort only on actual client disconnect" behaviour.

/**
 * Convert a Fastify request's lifecycle into an `AbortSignal` the

 *
 * Locked behaviour (do not loosen without re-reading the abort-on-body
 * debug session in the v3 mutations slice):
 *
 *   - For body-bearing requests (POST/PATCH), Fastify finishes
 *     consuming the request stream BEFORE our handler runs. Node
 *     emits `close` on the IncomingMessage immediately after that.
 *     If we abort unconditionally on `close`, every request appears
 *     "aborted" to the worker, even when the client is happily
 *     awaiting the response.
 *
 *   - The fix: only abort when the request stream did NOT finish
 *     reading (`req.raw.complete === false`). That distinguishes a
 *     real client disconnect from a normal end-of-body signal.
 *
 *   - `req.raw.aborted` is checked up front for the rare case where
 *     the client tore down the connection before the handler started.
