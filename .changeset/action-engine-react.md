'@embedpdf/react': minor

New `@embedpdf/react/actions` entry with `useActionsUiAdapter` (browser-default URI open through `sanitizeExternalUri` + print dialog, overridable per handler), a `useCapabilityEvent` hook for capability event subscriptions, and link-layer delegation: chain-bearing URI links drop the native `href` fast path so the dispatcher runs the whole chain (the `'dispatched'` outcome opens nothing itself — the adapter owns it).

Widget fill controls become always-active `/AA` event surfaces, link anchors feed link hover events, and scripting-provider defaults use the dispatch origin when deciding whether to suppress lifecycle/boot UI effects.

Route sibling feature dependencies through plugin contract/helper entries. Annotation selection hooks and anchor equality helpers are split into leaf modules so form and annotation-menu entries no longer import the full annotation feature implementation.

Render PDF list boxes as visible native scrolling controls in both form surfaces, with stable optimistic selection and wheel isolation so row hit-testing, selection, and scrolling stay synchronized while engine writes complete. Combo boxes retain their baked resting appearance and native popup behavior.

Keep keyboard focus indicators above baked PDF appearances so checkboxes and choice controls display the same clear blue focus ring as text fields and radio buttons.
