 * current rotation, so that read+arithmetic lives HERE — once — instead of
 * being re-derived in every framework adapter's click handler.
 *
 * Document-scoped: rotation is shared document metadata, so editing through the
 * sidebar lens and seeing it in the main lens is automatic (both read the same
 * registry, which the kernel keeps in sync from the engine's event stream).
