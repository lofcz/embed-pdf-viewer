/**
 * Example-only: register the insert / redact authoring tools as INERT
 * interaction tools. v3 doesn't yet ship signature or redaction plugins, but
 * this is a CHROME demo — its job is selection state and layout, not the
 * tool's effect. Registering them as real (behaviourless) tools lets every
 * tool button in every mode band go through the SAME path
 * (`InteractionToken.activateTool`), so `active` is uniform and honest: the
 * button really is the active tool; it just has no handler behind it.
 *
 * The annotate + shapes tools are NOT here — those are real tools the
 * annotation plugin registers (highlight, ink, square, circle, …) — and
 * neither are the form palette tools (the form plugin's draw-to-place).
