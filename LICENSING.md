Everything in this repository is licensed under the

self-hostable CloudPDF server — is **Fair Source**, under the

(FCL-1.0-ALv2).

The rule behind the line: **libraries are Apache-2.0; the deployable server
product is Fair Source.** Client SDKs, contracts, engines, viewers, plugins —
anything you link into your own software — carry no strings. The server is the
product we sell, so it ships fair-source instead of proprietary.

## What the FCL means for you

- **Source-available, not free to run.** The FCL lets you inspect, copy, and
  modify the source for a Permitted Purpose, subject to its terms, but it does
  not grant you a CloudPDF license. The server fails closed: running or
  self-hosting a current FCL-licensed release requires a valid CloudPDF license
  key, or a signed certificate for an air-gapped deployment.
- **The license gate must remain intact.** You may not move, change, disable,
  or circumvent the license-key functionality; enable protected functionality
  without a valid key; or remove protected functionality.
- **No Competing Use.** You may not use the server for a Competing Use as
  defined in the FCL, including offering a product or service that substitutes
  for CloudPDF or provides the same or substantially similar functionality.
- **It becomes Apache-2.0 automatically.** Each release converts to the Apache
  License 2.0 two years after it is made available — per release, so an old
  enough version is plain open source.

The licensor is CloudPDF LTD.

## Website content

The websites' application code is Apache-2.0 like the rest of the repository;
their _content_ is zoned — see [`website/LICENSE`](website/LICENSE) and
[`cloudpdf/website/LICENSE`](cloudpdf/website/LICENSE):

- documentation prose: CC-BY-4.0;
- code samples in the docs: MIT-0 (copy freely, no attribution needed);
- articles, blog posts, and brand assets: all rights reserved.

## Trademarks

"EmbedPDF", "CloudPDF", the logos, and the design-system assets are brand
property of CloudPDF LTD. Neither Apache-2.0 (§6) nor the FCL grants trademark
rights.

## Authority

For any package, the authoritative declaration is its own `LICENSE` file and
the `license` field of its `package.json`. Directory placement decides nothing.
(`@cloudpdf/server`'s `package.json` reads `SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE` because
FCL-1.0-ALv2 is not yet an SPDX identifier.)
